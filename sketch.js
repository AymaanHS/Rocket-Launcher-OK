// The story of my game is:-                  (You can read the Story in Story.js file as well)

// One fine day, There was a boy in Noida. 
// He woke up early in the morning to go to school. He saw that his father was not ready to go to office and
//  instead watcing, so he asked his father that why was'nt he ready to go to office? His father replied that
// Today, the whole India is sitting home and waiting for the launch. The kid got confused that what is he 
// talking about? His father explained that India is launcing its first Rocket, so whole india is off today
// and waiting for the launch. 10 mins before launch every channel on TV will highlight it and show you the
// live telecast of it. 

// At night, the kid got a dream that he is flying the rocket in space and suddenly a space storm comes and 
// he have to protect the rocket otherwise the rocket would crash.

//      PLAY the Game and help the kid save from being crashed.

//            RULES                             (You can also read it in Rules.js file.)                       

// So here are the Controls of the Game:-
// By pressing the SPACE key, rocket's speed would increae nut as soon as you stop pressing space key it will fell down your game would be Over.
// To move rocket left or right, use ARROW keys.

// This game does not require mouse to play, just by keys.

// Score will keep increasing until the game is over. It will calculate distance traveled by the rocket.
    
 
//               DOUBTS or PROBLEMS      (For Teacher)
//   1. As soon as rocket touches the stone, the gameState is not changing to END.
//   2. The distance traveling is not showing but as soon as gameState changes to end, it is visible. That means that the distance is being calculated behind the space Img.
